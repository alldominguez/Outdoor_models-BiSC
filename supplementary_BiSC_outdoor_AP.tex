\subsection{Predictor variables and sources of information}

\subsection{Performance metrics}
The following metrics were used to evaluate the LUR model for all the air pollution assessed. 



% --- R2 --- %
\begin{equation}
R^2 = \left( \frac{\sum (\hat{y}_i - \bar{y})^2}{\sum (y_i - \bar{y})^2} \right)
\end{equation}

% --- root mean squared error (RMSE) --- % 
\begin{equation}
\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}
\end{equation}

% --- mean bias (MB) --- % 
\begin{equation}
\text{Mean Bias} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)
\end{equation}

% --- correlation coefficient (r) --- %
\begin{equation}
r = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2 \sum (y_i - \bar{y})^2}}
\end{equation}
