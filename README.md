This repository contains all the materials for create the figures for the research article **"Development of land use regression, dispersion, and hybrid models for prediction of outdoor air pollution exposure in Barcelona"**. 

In this study, within the framework of the **Barcelona Life Study Cohort (BiSC)**, we developed land use regression (LUR), dispersion (DM), and hybrid (HM) models to estimate outdoor air pollution exposure at residential addresses. LUR and DM, were constructed using conventional state-of-the-art techniques, while HM was innovatively designed by harnessing RF algorithm, integrating outputs from DM with explanatory variables from the LUR model. The overall aim of this study was to obtain accurate NO<sub>2</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, BC  and PM<sub>2.5</sub> constituents (Fe, Zn, Cu, Sb) estimates, intended to be used in the exposure assessment for the BiSC cohort.
