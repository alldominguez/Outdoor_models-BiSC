This repository contains all the materials for the article **"Development of outdoor air pollution models for estimating
exposure in the Barcelona Life Study Cohort (BiSC)"**. 

In this study, within the framework of the **Barcelona Life Study Cohort (BiSC)**, we developed and compared land use regression (LUR), dispersion (DM), and hybrid (HM) models to estimate outdoor air pollution exposure at residential addresses. LUR and DM, were constructed using conventional state-of-the-art techniques, while HM was innovatively designed by harnessing RF algorithm, integrating outputs from DM with explanatory variables from the LUR model. The overall aim of this study was to obtain accurate NO<sub>2</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, BC  and PM<sub>2.5</sub> constituents (Fe, Zn, Cu, Sb) estimates, intended to be used in the prenatal exposure assessment within the BiSC cohort.
